  <h1> What are the jumps really like?</h1>
  <p class='synopsishow'> Its hard to really explain what it is like to hit jumps on a bike so I am
  going to include a video a friend of mine made a while ago.<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ZcTSqOHIk'> Riding Jumps at Deer Valley</a>
Hopefully this video helps to better illustrate it.</p>
