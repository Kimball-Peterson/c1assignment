    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p class='synopsiswhy'>The Y jumps are some of the biggest, sketchiest, yet most thrilling
    jumps found among Utahs many mountain biking and bmx hotspots. They include
  beautiful views and <strong>huge</strong> jumps. The gaps are long, and the
landings short but it is still a great spot to ride and learn in the air.</p>
