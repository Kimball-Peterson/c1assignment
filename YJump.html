<h1>The Y Jumps</h1>
<p class= 'synopsiswhy'> The Y jumps, located in Provo, Utah are a mainstay in the
  freeride mountain bike community of Utah and have long provided a beautiful spot
  to ride and gather. They came to be many years ago when a view college students
  were looking for a spot to build jumps and trails and push their limits. They
  since been through many different versions and changes to become what they are today.
  One thing has stayed true throughout their whole existence and that is that they
  are founded in a love for the sport and community that surrounds it.</p>
